Note that you cannot make an attempt more than once per action, regardless of the D6 result.\n\n**Boons of Damnation:**\n- When an attack dice inflicts damage of 3 or more on this operative, you can ignore an amount of damage equal to this operative's Damnation points.\n- When this operative is fighting or retaliating and you strike, you can inflict an amount of additional damage equal to this operative's Damnation points."

In the first Firefight phase, when this operative is activated, place one of your Warp markers wholly within your territory, then expend this operative.\n\nIn the second Firefight phase, when this operative is activated, set it up with an order of your choice in a location it can be placed either wholly within your drop zone, or wholly within your territory contesting your Warp marker. Continue its activation as normal, but during that activation it cannot perform more than two actions and cannot use more than 4\" of move distance. Until the Ready step of the next Strategy phase, this operative is obscured to operatives more than 3\" from it.\n\nWhenever this operative is in the warp, it cannot be the ready friendly MURDERWING operative for the Malicious Narcissism firefight ploy."
