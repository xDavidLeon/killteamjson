  "description": "Counted amongst the complement of many Navis Imperialis vessels, Navy Breachers are elite Voidsmen who are outfitted, trained and endlessly drilled in boarding actions and void-based combat. Wielding a wide array of cutting gear, boarding shields and close-range weapons, they are well-suited to deadly combat in close confines.",

UNIT\n  - ENDURANT\n  - GHEISTSKULL\n  - GRENADIER\n  - GUNNER with Navis las-volley and gun butt\n  - GUNNER with meltagun and gun butt\n  - GUNNER with plasma gun and gun butt\n  - HATCHCUTTER\n  - SURVEYOR\n  - VOID-JAMMER\n\nOther than ARMSMAN operatives, your kill team can only include each operative on this list once. Your kill team can only include up to two GUNNER operatives.  \n\nYour kill team can only include a GHEISTSKULL operative if it also includes a VOID-JAMMER operative, and it can only include a C.A.T. UNIT operative if it also includes a SURVEYOR operative.  \n\nThese operatives count as half a selection each, meaning you can select both of them and it's treated as one selection in total.",
