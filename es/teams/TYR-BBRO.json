  "description": "Brood Brothers are the humans of the Genestealer Cults, who have been implanted by Genestealers and have served as hosts for their Genestealer Hybrid offspring.  \n\nMany of these Brood Brothers may be members of the local civil or military authorities, continuing to carry out their normal duties in society. They remain hidden until the cult/clan is powerful enough to completely take control of the host society. They regard and often venerate the Genestealer Patriarch as a grandfather or deity. They are especially fanatic members of the clan, motivated by intense, instinctual bonds to their Genestealer and Hybrid relatives. ",
  "composition": "A BROOD BROTHER KillTeam is composed of:\n\n- 1 BROOD BROTHER Commander operative with one of the following options:\n  - Bolt pistol, chainsword and claw\n  - Drum-fed autogun, bayonet,\n  - Laspistol, power weapon and claw=\n- 9 BROOD BROTHER operatives selected from the following list:\n  - Agitator\n  - Gunner with Flamer and bayonet (1)\n  - Gunner with Grenade Launcher and bayonet (1)\n  - Gunner with Meltagun and bayonet (1)\n  - Gunner with Plasma gun and bayonet (1)\n  - Iconward\n  - Knife Fighter\n  - Medic\n  - Sapper\n  - Sniper (1)\n  - Trooper\n  - Veteran\n  - Vox-Operator\n- 3 Brood Brother operatives selected from the following list (3):\n  - 2 Psychic Familiar operatives (Still count as one selection)\n  - Magus (Count as two selections) (2)\n  - Patriarch (Count as three selections) (2)\n  - Primus (Count as two selections) (2)\n  - Trooper\n\nOther than Trooper operatives, your kill team can only include each option on this list once.  \n\n(1) You cannot select more than three of these operatives combined.  \n\n(2) Your Kill team can only include up to one BROODCOVEN operative. If one of these operatives is selected for deployment, your Commander operative loses the Leader keyword for the battle.  \n\n(3) Up to three times, instead of selecting one of these operatives, you can select one BROOD BROTHER ploy to cost you 0CP for the battle. Note that \"count as\" selections still apply; for example, if you select a Patriarch operative, you could not do this.",
