You cannot use each PRIVATEER SUPPORT ASSET more than once per battle.  \n \nWhenever a friendly ELUCIDIAN STARSTRIDER operative is using a PRIVATEER SUPPORT ASSET, determine cover saves differently. Instead, the target has a cover save if any part of its base is underneath Vantage terrain. Note that while this can affect the target's cover save, you must still select a valid target as normal. In other words, the shot is guided by an operative in the killzone, but it comes from above.\n\n|**Name**|**ATK**|**HIT**|**DMG**|\n|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|Archeotech Beam|4|3+|6/7|\n|Heavy (Repos), Piercing 2, Silent||||\n|Plasma Battery|5|4+|5/6|\n|Heavy (Repos), Lethal 5+, Piercing 1, Silent||||\n|Macrocannon|5|4|4/5|\n|Heavy (Repos), Piercing Crit 1, Saturate, Silent, Torrent 2\"||||\n|Guided Shell|5|4+|3/4|\n|Heavy (Repos), Blast 2\", Silent||||\n|Cluster Bomb|5|4+|2/3|\n|Heavy (Repos), Blast 3\", Silent||||"
