  "composition": "A SCOUT SQUAD killteam is composed of:\n\n- 1 SCOUT SQUAD Sergeant operative with one of the following options:\n  - Astartes shotgun, fists\n  - Boltgun, fists\n  - Bolt Pistol, Chainsword\n- 8 SCOUT SQUAD operatives selected from the following list:\n  - Heavy Gunner with Fists, Bolt Pistol and Heavy Bolter\n  - Heavy Gunner with Fists, Bolt Pistol and Missile Launcher\n  - Hunter\n  - Sniper\n  - Tracker\n  - Warrior with one of the following options:\n    - Astartes Shotgun, fists\n    - Boltgun, Fists\n    - Bolt Pistol, Combat Blade\n\nOther than Warrior operatives, your Killteam can only include each operative once.",
